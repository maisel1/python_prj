# steps:
#1)
# You must create at least TWO classes.
# For now, just focus on:
# Planning Your Two Classes
# Creating a Basic Constructor (__init__() method)

#2)
# Each of those classes must have at least THREE attributes and THREE methods.
# You may need to create some instances of your classes to test your methods.

#3)
# Your classes should be able to describe themselves (through a __repr__() method).
# You will need to create at least one instance of your classes to test your __repr__() method.

#4)
# If you havenâ€™t already, create at least TWO instances of every one of your classes.
# Test all of the methods you created on both of the objects you create.

#5)
# Create some methods, or additional attributes, that make your two Classes able to interact with each other.
